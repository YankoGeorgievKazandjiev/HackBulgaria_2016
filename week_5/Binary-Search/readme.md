# Tasks for Binary Search

## Binary Search on Python

Implement the following function, which returns a index of `element`.

```python
def binary_search(array, start, end, element):
    pass
```

## Turning Point

 Find a point where arrays starts decreasing, array is first increasing and then decreasing.
 For example if we have following array `[1, 3, 7, 9, 4, 2]`, the turning point is `4` and index of this point also is `4`.

`[1, 6, 4, 3, 2]` -> Turning point is `4` on index `2`.

`[1, 4, 5, 2]`-> Turning point is `2` on index `3`.

 ```python
def find_turning_point(array, start, end):
    pass
```
