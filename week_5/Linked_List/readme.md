# Linked List

## Let's implement our own simple linked list

We have a boilerplate with all functions for Simple Linked List, your task is to implement these functions in it. Also, we have an example 2 tests and you need to write tests for all functions.  

## Double Linked List

Now,  we want our Simple Linked List to be Double Linked List, for that we need to implement two more functions:

```python
def add_last(self, data):
    pass

def remove_last(self, data):
    pass

```
